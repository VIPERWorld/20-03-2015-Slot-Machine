Exercise I found on the internet. Create a slot machine with a basic GUI in Java.

Beginner level coding.

Uses Swing GUI, 

Threads, 

Playing sounds, 

Displaying images,

Enums,

Exception handling.



<h3> TODO </h3>

Improve combination checking:

Two held slots should result in a 3-combo if the last slot rolls to the correct icon.
